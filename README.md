# GODOT ROGUELIKE

This is a simple roguelike game built in Godot.

Goals for this project are to gain experience designing and building large systems with a small team.

Plan is to include turn based RPG combat with roguelike elements to build your character
by obtaining gear and experience as well as followers to defeat the final boss.

flow:
	- start game by selecting a class
	- work your way through 3 stages similar to 'Slay the Spire' defeating a realm boss on each stage
	- each step will be a battle/shop/heal style node
	- wins from each battle can award experience, gold, equipment, or followers
	- a base building system for between runs to generate helpful materials
	- crafting system to create gear to be added as loot in future runs
